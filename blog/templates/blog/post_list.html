            <h2><a href="">Python is LOVEâ™¥</a></h2>
            <p>Python is one of those rare languages which can claim to be both simple and powerful.
                You will find yourself pleasantly surprised to see how easy it is to concentrate on the solution to
                the problem rather than the syntax and structure of the language you are programming in.</p>

            <h2><a href="">Story behind the name</a></h2>
            <p>Guido van Rossum, the creator of the Python language, named the language after the BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
                He doesn't particularly like snakes that kill animals for food by winding their long bodies around them and crushing them.</p>

            <h2><a href="">Features of Python</a></h2>
         <h3>Simple </h3>
            <p>Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good Python program feels almost like reading English,
                although very strict English! This pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its greatest strengths.
                It allows you to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself.</p>
